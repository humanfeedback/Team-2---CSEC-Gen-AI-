# Keylogger Project Documentation

## Introduction

This project outlines the development and deployment of a basic keylogger application written in Rust. The keylogger is designed to capture and transmit keystrokes from a victim's machine to a server for collection. This document provides a step-by-step guide on setting up and running the keylogger, along with necessary precautions and requirements.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed on your development machine:

- Rust programming language setup, including Cargo (Rust's package manager and build system).
- A TCP listener tool (e.g., Netcat) for receiving the keystroke data.
- Access to both a server machine (to collect keystroke data) and a victim machine (to deploy the keylogger).

**Note:** This software is intended for educational purposes or authorized penetration testing only. Unauthorized use on machines without explicit permission is illegal and unethical.

## Setup Instructions

### Configuring the Server Address

1. Open the `main.rs` file in your preferred text editor.
2. Locate the line containing a hardcoded IP address assignment. Replace the existing IP address with the IP address of your server machine.

### Building the Keylogger

1. In your terminal, navigate to the project directory containing the modified `main.rs` file.
2. Run the following command to build the keylogger executable:
   ```shell
   cargo run
   ```
3. Once the build is complete, locate the `keylogger.exe` file in the target directory.

### Setting Up the Server Listener

1. On your server machine, open a terminal.
2. Start a TCP listener on port 4444 (or your chosen port) using Netcat or an equivalent tool:
   ```shell
   nc -lvp 4444
   ```
   This command will initiate a listening state on the specified port, ready to receive keystroke data.

## Usage

To deploy the keylogger:

1. Transfer the `keylogger.exe` file to the victim machine.
2. Execute the keylogger on the victim machine. This action may require disabling anti-virus software temporarily to avoid detection.
3. Once the keylogger is running, it will establish a connection to the server listener and begin transmitting keystroke data.

**Warning:** Be mindful of anti-virus and security software on the victim machine that may block or detect the keylogger's operation. Disabling such software poses significant security risks and should be done with caution and appropriate permissions.

## Legal and Ethical Warning

This tool is provided for educational purposes and authorized security testing only. Unauthorized use of this software to intercept or collect data from individuals without their explicit consent is illegal and unethical. It is the user's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and ethics guidelines when using or deploying this software.

## Conclusion

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to setting up, deploying, and using the keylogger project. By following the outlined steps, users can successfully capture and analyze keystroke data for educational or authorized security testing purposes.
